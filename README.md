### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 3rd-year Informatics engineering student at Bandung Institute of Technology specializing in front-end development, android development, and interested in educational development. I am fairly experienced with all stages of the development cycle for dynamic web projects and android development, while also experienced in various programming languages such as HTML5, PHP OOP, JavaScript, CSS, Python, SQL/NoSQL, Java, and Kotlin. I would love to continuously learn more and make best practices.
